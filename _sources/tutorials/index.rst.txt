Jupyter Notebooks
**************************
These python notebooks can be found in the main code repository, under *notebooks*, and are fully interactable. They provide a high-level introduction to interfacing with **Harmonic**, ranging from how to easily pick up **Harmonic** and apply it to a project to more involved checkpointing and cross-validation for large scale, complex inferences.

One should note that **Harmonic** acts on chains of posterior samples to infer the evidence, and is thus agnostic to the select sampler. In these notebooks we adopt the popular and highly accessible `emcee  <http://dfm.io/emcee/current/>`_ package for sampling, though alternate (perhaps custom) samplers are equally applicable.
